== Debugging Tips

Use http-https-echo-chart to test the OIDC flow. The chart is available at:

Areas for Potential Improvement:

    Consider adding API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger)
    Add more comprehensive test coverage (I see test dependencies but would need to check actual test files)
    Consider adding rate limiting for security
    Add more detailed logging for security events
    Consider adding circuit breakers for external service calls

 Deployment:
    Good Kubernetes/Helm support with deployment configurations
    Docker container support
    Proper configuration for different environments

Documentation:

Good README and documentation files
Azure Entra ID setup documentation
Helm deployment instructions
